module concurrency.stoptoken;

// Cancellation is an important concept when running asynchronous tasks.
// When an asynchronous operation is no longer needed it is desirable to
// cancel it to avoid doing unnecessary work, potentionally freeing system
// resources and maintaining responsiveness in the process.

// There are several reasons why an asynchronous operation might become
// irrelevant, including:

// - An error in one part of an application might render the results of
// other ongoing asynchronous tasks irrelevant.

// - Clients or end-users might want to abort an earlier request they made.

// - Outstanding work might need to be cancelled due to stale data.

// - Work might become irrelevant due to errors in external systems.

// - As part of control flow in an asynchronous algorithm. Similar to how
// you might have an `break` or early `return` in a synchronous piece of
// code.

// This module implements cooperative cancellation by providing a StopSource,
// StopToken and StopCallback.

// - the StopSource represents the source of a cancellation request.
// - the StopToken is used to determine if a cancellation request has been
//   initiated.
// - the StopCallback is invoked when a cancellation request has been
//   initiated.

// Implementation details:

// Allocations can have a non-neglible overhead when running many short-lived
// asynchronous tasks. For this reason these objects are designed to be used
// in-place on the stack.

// To ensure program safety and correctness we need to uphold that a
// `StopSource` outlives any associated `StopToken` or `StopCallback`,
// otherwise we might open ourselves to use-after-free errors.

// We achieve that by:

// - having a StopCallback deregister itself from a StopSource on destruction
// - having a StopSource deregister any StopCallbacks still registered on
// destruction
// - relying on `scope` StopTokens to ensure they don't outlive the
// StopSource
// - disabling copy and assignment constructors for the StopSource and
// StopToken
// - relying on dip1000

/// A StopSource represents the source of a cancellation request. You can think
/// of it as the entity that initiates the request for cancellation.
/// Once a stop is requested, it cannot be withdrawn. Additional stop requests
/// have no effect.
